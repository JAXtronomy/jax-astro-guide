# Introduction to JAX

JAX is a numerical computing library that brings together the power of automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration. It is designed to enable high-performance machine learning research and other scientific computing tasks. JAX's ability to transform numerical functions and execute them on various hardware accelerators makes it a valuable tool for researchers.

## Importance in Astronomy Research

In the field of astronomy, JAX is particularly important because it allows researchers to efficiently process and analyze large datasets, perform complex simulations, and develop sophisticated models. The ability to leverage GPU acceleration means that computations can be performed much faster, enabling more detailed and timely insights into astronomical phenomena.
